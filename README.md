Hi there!!👋

I'm Evgeny. I work as a full-time software engineer. In my spare time I do open-sourcing (normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work). Most of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing - to help people learn 📚. You may use these projects to learn about algorithms in JavaScript and get prepared for technical interviews.
